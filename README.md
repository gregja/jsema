JS adaptation of the book Elementary Mathematics from an Algorithmic Standpoint

----- 

I discovered recently the book "Elementary Mathematics from an Algorithmic Standpoint" of Arthur Engel...
in its french version, published in 1979 by CEDIC editions, under the title :
"mathématique élémentaire d'un point de vue algorithmique" (french adaptation by Daniel Reisz)

-----

For fun, and because I think the challenge is interesting, I decided to adapt all the BASIC
examples of the book, to the Javascript language. It will be a good opportunity to improve my 
knowledges in mathematics, and to check the calculus precision of the Javascript. 

This is a book of 300 pages, with a lot of BASIC code, so... wish me luck !

For more informations about the precision of calculus, depending of the languages, I recommend
